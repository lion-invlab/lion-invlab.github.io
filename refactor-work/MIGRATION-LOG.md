# TAC HTML Refactor — Migration Log

## 2026-10-24 — Baseline and CSS extraction

- Working branch: `tac-design-system-work-2026-10-24`
- Frozen baseline: `refactor-work/source-baseline-2026-10-26.html`
- Frozen source SHA: `8e905bb16e6ea1575fded3b781b86597241ffd9d`
- Candidate v1: CSS design-system scaffold linked; no component classes migrated.
- Candidate v2: all 95 style elements moved to head in order; static DOM checks passed.
- Candidate v3: all 95 style blocks extracted in original order to `legacy-cascade.css`; HTML contains no inline style tags and references legacy + design-system stylesheets.
- Candidate v4: self-contained HTML with one consolidated style block, all 10 script blocks unchanged, one DOCTYPE, no duplicate IDs, all main-panel IDs retained.
- Design tokens: original nine root variables moved to `design-system.css` with identical values; `legacy-cascade.css` now begins with a migration note instead of the old root declaration.
- Audit: no detected JavaScript references to the original style-node IDs; no stylesheet links existed in source; CSS selectors did not target the style-node IDs.

## Validation status

- Static structure and source-order checks: passed for candidate v4.
- Browser screenshots / computed-style comparison: not yet run in this environment.
- Interactive regression: not yet run.
- Visual quality upgrade: not yet verified; no claim of completion.
- Official homepage / official mother templates: untouched.

## Next work

1. Add a browser-capable visual regression step before applying broad appearance changes.
2. Migrate shared panel shell and heading styles with a documented selector map.
3. Migrate radio tabs and disclosures separately, preserving their checked-state selectors and mobile behavior.
4. Remove legacy overrides only after each component's visual and interaction regression passes.
